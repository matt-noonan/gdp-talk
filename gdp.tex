\noindent      [Rico Mariani] admonished us to think about
how we can build platforms that lead developers
to write great, high performance code such that
developers just fall into doing the “right thing”.
\medskip

\noindent
That concept really resonated with me. It is the
key point of good API design.

APIs that steer and point developers in the right

  \section{How can we make good APIs?}   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Narrowing the focus}
  Specifically, how can we make APIs that are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \bigskip
  \item {\alert{Safe.} \\ \qquad Incorrect use of the API should result in an error
    \\ \qquad at compile-time.}
    \bigskip
  \item {\alert{Ergonomic.} \\ \qquad Correct use of an API should not place an undue \\
    \qquad burden on the user.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What is the goal?}
  In this talk, we will investigate how
  \bigskip\alert{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{existentially-quantified type-level names for values,}
    \medskip
  \item{theorems as phantom types, and}
    \medskip
  \item{safe coercions}
  \end{itemize}}
  \bigskip
  
  \noindent can combine to provide a safe and ergonomic strategy for designing APIs
  with complex requirements.
